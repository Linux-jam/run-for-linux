# Run for Linux

## Overview
Run for Linux brings the familiar Windows 10 "Run" dialog (Ctrl+R) to Linux! This lightweight utility lets you quickly launch applications, open files, or execute commands directly from a simple, keyboard-friendly interface. Designed for Linux users who miss the snappy Windows Run experience or want a fast way to interact with their system.

## Features
- **Quick Launch**: Open apps, files, or directories with a single command.
- **Keyboard-Driven**: Trigger the dialog with Ctrl+R, just like Windows.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal resource usage, perfect for any Linux distro.
- **Customizable**: Configure shortcuts or extend functionality to suit your workflow.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Linux-jam/run-for-linux.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```

   ```

## Usage
1. Run the main script:

   ```
2. Press `Ctrl+R` to open the Run dialog.
3. Type a command, app name, or file path (e.g., `firefox`, `~/Documents`, or `ls -la`).
4. Hit `Enter` to execute!
